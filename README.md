# Axela
Axela is a public domain reimplementation of the [Alexa](https://github.com/ebjohnston/alexa) IRC greeting bot. It is designed to provide robust functionality and decent reliability while being easy to read and maintain.

## Need to fix
- Bottle spin settings don't change on nick change or profile delete
- Channel names are case sensitive
- Bottle spins and greetings can't be disabled in whole channels yet
- Fully consistent formatting (though lint passes)
